# WUT-AB-Test-2
Attempt with React


This is an attempt at an Address book in React. 
It can display the required info from a back end server set up in Node.
You can find that in the server folder.

It has buttons with which to Add, Delete, or Edit.

Unfortunately, because I spent approximately 6 hours on trying to do this in Ionic,
only the Add button attempts to do anything. Unfortunately, due to CORS errors, I was unable
to actually get it to add.
